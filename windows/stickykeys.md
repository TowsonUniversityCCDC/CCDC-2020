# sticky keys
This is a somewhat common persistence mechanism. To do this, RDP to a machine
and hit these keystrokes prior to login.

* setc.exe - shift 5 times
* utilman.exe - windows + u
* osk.exe - windows + u, launch on-screen keyboard
* displayswitch.exe - windows + p

Check c:\windows\system32 for these binaries. If they are powershell, cmd, or
some other sketchy thing, the backdoor is present.
